# GraphQL Job Board with TypeScript

This project is a full-stack application using TypeScript, GraphQL, Node.js, and Apollo Server with Express. It is split into two main directories: `server` for the backend and `client` for the frontend.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Overview

- The `server` directory contains the code for the Apollo Server setup, GraphQL schema definitions, resolvers, and authentication logic.
- The `client` directory holds the React application that interacts with the GraphQL server using Apollo Client and GraphQL-Request.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

- Node.js
- npm

### Installing

#### Server

1. Navigate to the `server` directory:

```bash
cd server
```

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm start
```

The GraphQL server will be running on http://localhost:9000/graphql and you can access the Apollo Server playground at this URL if it's enabled in the server configuration.

### Client

1. Navigate to the `client` directory:

```bash
cd server
```

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm start
```

The client application will be available at http://localhost:3000.
